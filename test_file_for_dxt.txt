This is a test file created to test DXT file operations.
Created on: 2025-07-18
Purpose: Testing hybrid Docker MCP + DXT configuration
Project: Gmail Classifier AI

Features to test:
1. File reading via Docker MCP
2. File writing via Docker MCP  
3. Directory listing via Docker MCP
4. Compare with DXT functionality (when available)

Expected behavior:
- Docker MCP should provide full file access
- DXT should provide simplified file access (when installed)
- Both should work simultaneously in hybrid configuration
